## Description

This workshop introduces attendees to the principles of writing ‘clean’
code, that is easier to read, maintain, and expand. Attendees will learn
about organizing complex programming scripts into modular functions,
writing effective documentation, and habits to improve code robustness
and reusability.

*Attendees will be expected to have basic familiarity with programming,
such as experience writing simple scripts or recent attendance at a
Carpentries workshop* - <https://www.uf-carpentries.org/>

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:

-   organize programming tasks into modular functions
-   communicate code intent using comments
-   recognize and fix basic code smells
