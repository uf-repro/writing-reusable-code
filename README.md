<!-- badges: end -->

## Description

This workshop helps attendees advance their programming skills through
instruction in writing functions. Attendees will learn about the DRY
principle (“Don’t Repeat Yourself”) and tips on turning complex code
into more manageable chunks, improving code robustness and reusability.

*Attendees will be expected to have basic familiarity with programming,
such as experience writing simple scripts or recent attendance at a
Carpentries workshop* - <https://www.uf-carpentries.org/>

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:

  - write modular functions to reduce complexity and increase
    reproducibility
  - use good practices to comment code
  - recognize basic code smells
