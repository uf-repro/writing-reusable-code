Attendees will learn about the DRY principle (\"Don't Repeat Yourself\") and tips on turning complex code into more manageable chunks, improving code robustness and reusability.

*Attendees will be expected to have basic familiarity with programming, such as experience writing simple scripts or recent attendance at a Carpentries workshop* - https://www.uf-carpentries.org/"

## Learning Outcomes

```{r, include = FALSE}
learning_outcomes <- c("write modular functions to reduce complexity and increase reproducibility", 
                       "use good practices to comment code",
                       "recognize basic code smells")
