Attendees will learn about organizing complex programming scripts into modular functions, writing effective documentation, and habits to improve code robustness and reusability.

## Description

`r lesson_description`

## Learning Outcomes

```{r, include = FALSE}
learning_outcomes <- c("organize programming tasks into modular functions", 
                       "communicate code intent using comments",
                       "recognize and fix basic code smells")
outcomes_text <- paste0("* ", learning_outcomes, collapse = "\n")
desc::desc_set("learningOutcomes", outcomes_text)
```

By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:

`r outcomes_text`

```{r make cff file, include = FALSE}
cffr::cff_write(keys = list("type" = "lesson"))
```
